        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
            occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 
            8 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
            Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 
            minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. 
            Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, 
            about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
